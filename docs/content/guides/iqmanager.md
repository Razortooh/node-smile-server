The SMILE Teacher Android App is designed to allow the Teacher to organize the Epoch SMILE learning session.

## Logging In

Every session begins with the Teacher and Students logging in.  The default Server IP address (*10.1.0.1*) will be prefilled for the Teacher.  If the default address doesn't suit you, enter one appropriate to your installation.

Your login screen may look slightly different, depending on branding used in your installation, or depending on screen size.

## Session Set Up

The next important step is to set up the Session.  The default information screen has values prefilled.

The Teacher can fill in the fields with information relevant to the new session: *Teacher Name*, *Session Title*, *Group Name*.  This information is used later in the session, when the session is saved for later review in the IQManager.

## Choose Question Setup

After providing session information, the Teacher will need to choose the Question Setup, either 

1. *Start Making Questions* - This allows students to start making their own questions, thus starting the session
1. *Use Prepared Questions* - This allows students to start a session using previously prepared questions

If Teacher chooses to *Use Prepared Questions*, a dialog will open and it will be possible to choose the prepared questions.  The question sets are also known as *IQSets* (Inquiry Sets).  If no prepared questions are available, none will be displayed.  The Teacher should select an IQSet to use in the Session.  Note, the details of each IQSet are present, with information coming from the Session setup details of past sessions.
