The Epoch IQManager is designed to allow the Teacher to organize Inquiry Sets for an Epoch SMILE learning session.

## Logging In

The IQManager can be reached using the browser at the default Server IP address (*http://10.1.0.1/smile-iqmanager.html*).  If the default address doesn't suit you, enter one appropriate to your installation.

## Creating an IQSet

The steps to create an IQSet are described below.  We recommend using a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel to export a CSV file.  Use the IQSet_Template.xls to create IQSets.

## Viewing IQSessions

An IQSession is just a term for the in-class inquiry session.  Any time you run a session to completion (by hitting Show Results), the session will be saved automatically using session details provided on the setup.  You can review this information as a way to understand the progress of your class, or to check the records for particular students.
